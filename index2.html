       <div class="div2"><p class="p">The first clear break in observastional overcast was opened upon 1912 by Miss Henrietta S. Leavitt, an assistant at Harvard observatory. She was studying stars periodically varied in brightness, and discovered more than twenty cephaid variable stars in the magellinic cloud. The brighter the cepheid was the lobger it took to vary. Four years, later she observed that the period of variation of the cephaid depended on it's luminosity. Ejnar Hertzpurg realized Henrietta's discoveries might be key to measuring the universe, and these astronomers were able to figure out how much light a star was sending out. And by relating that quantity to the apparent brightness, they found out the star's distance from our galaxy. </p></div>
